Chris:  Attached is the Windows version of the software (VE.llb).  The Labview student edition used to be free but I just went to the National Instruments web page and they now charge $80.  If you acquire it, the student edition should run the software just fine.  At least I know the Mac version will, I am not sure of the Windows version.

Once you have Labview, make a folder on the C-drive called ViewECMO.  Put VE in that folder.  Once VE is saved to ViewECMO, double click on the VE icon.  Click on the little arrow in the upper left hand corner of VE and it should run.  If you hold down the "control" key and hit the "E" key at the same time it shows the "wiring diagram" which is the way Labview does the graphical programming.  E-mail me and we can set up a time to discuss the crazy way I did the programming.

I tried to send this from my work email and it crashed so I am sending this from my home account.
